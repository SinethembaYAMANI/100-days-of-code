“Patients are the most underutilized resource in health care” – Warner Slack. For the #100DaysOfCode challenge, I'll be building an e-patient IoT application to allow health concerned patients to participate fully in their medical care. Which vital sign should I monitor first?

Day 1/100 #100DaysOfCode to develop my e-patient IoT platform, I've selected the #NodeMCU controller and using #MicroPython for #programming. Both these platforms are new to me (I know c/c++), but I got a blinky working today :). More on #Github. #esp8266 #uPyCraft

Day 2/100 #100DaysOfCode. Poll has ended, people voted for a blood pressure sensor, though I'll later add more sensors. Today I finished the project plan and will need to build a sensor -> server -> web UI for my ePatient #IoT platform. #MicroPython -> #Python -> #php #c #java
